# Using a VPS as your remote desktop worksation
I use SSH terminals all almost every working day. There is almost something Zen-like using a simple command line to get things done. A great example of this is using Vim as my coding interface. It quick and a rock solid with a vast array of plugins. Combine that with tmux to ensure stability with those pesky unstable connections makes for a great working enviroment.
